# what are Frameworks ?

Frameworks are code libraries, that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use
for routines programming , features abd tasks.

# script tag 

is how we link our html file with our JS file.
and run it in our live server.
Example : <script src="app.js"></script>

# Console on google  chrome 

on the console we can run commands too ,
same as we did  the alert function we can run it on the console too , as well as adding numbers ex:1+1 .
one that i liked it was document 
typing document on the console , it will give us the whole structute of the Html , and if we want to select something from the DOM  we can do that throught here .
EXAMPLE : document.querySelector('h1').style.color = "red" .
this way we will access to the h1 tag in the HTML file from our 
JS file


# Log console.log - console.table- console.error

We can log into our console letters , number , booleans ,variables, arrays , objects literals

table print our object result in the console as a table 

error print our message in red as a error

clear(); this cleans our console in google chrome 

time & timeEnd whatever we put between this two , it will tell us how long it took to run the lines of code ;

warn , it prints a warning in our console
